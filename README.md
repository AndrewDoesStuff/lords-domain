# The Lord's Domain

LSU CSC 4263 (Video Game Design) Game Project - The Lord's Domain

Our game concept is a 2D top-down game, that is about an apprentice wizard trying to become a certified wizard in the Lord’s Domain. He is taught by a master wizard named Greg. However, things go awry during the end of his apprenticeship if you do not complete the final task of Greg’s training(which would be murdering your friend). If you do not complete the final task you are sent to a dungeon-like area. This is where the game, in a sense, really begins and the player has to battle out of that area to reach the end of his journey to defeat Greg. The player will then go through his journey meeting many enemies that are defeated through minigames such as mini-puzzles and mini-platformers.
